Read is an app for Google Glass that hels you read *faster*. 

Because you don't have to move your eyes when you Read, you spend less time scanning for words and more time understanding them. 

We've found that after justa  few minutes, many users can read at least *600* words per minutes - nearly 3 times as fast as the average reading speed of 220 words per minute.
